>THE GAME

>> The game is a 2D dungeon explorer
Player can move in compass direction.
The goal is to reach Finish point tile.

>> A random enemy will appear every now and then
Which brings up a new screen.
There are 3 preloaded Enemy objects with different score worth, image, health and attack power.
The player character displayed on the top left hand corner
and the enemy bottom right hand corner with gradient health bar under each image.

In a while loop that check if either the player or the enemy still alive.

The player will get the first move
with three options to:
Attack
Defend
Retreat
Attack function will randomly generate a random number within player's attack power value
Which will reduce enemy's health.
Defend will reduce future damage receive by the player.
Retreat, if successful will take the player out of the mini game.
If player succeed killing the enemy a score will be given 
according to the current enemy's worth.

Enemy will move after the player
Enemy will make two preset move randomly.
Either Attacking the player or defend itself and sometimes it doesn't do anything.
Every attack will reduce player health offset by player's defend value.
Defend will reduce future damage done to enemy by the player.

At the end of the loop, the screen cleared and status are updated.
Health bar is displayed using percentage value with gradient color of black to orange.

If the loop ends.
Set a boolean value of isAlive to false if the player lose.
If the enemy dies, add the score and set the isEnemy boolean to false.

Player will return to level screen and continue their journey to the finish point.
